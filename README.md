# Game-Strategy-Visualizer-and-Solver
Objective:

The Game Strategy Visualizer and Solver is an interactive, web-based application designed to analyze and solve game theory problems. It allows users to input game scenarios (e.g., payoff matrices) and provides solutions for key game theory concepts like Nash Equilibria, Mixed Strategies, and more. The project focuses on real-time computation, visualization, and educational insights into game theory.

Key Features:

1. Payoff Matrix Solver:

Users can input payoff matrices (e.g., 2x2 or larger).

Computes Nash Equilibrium and Mixed Strategy Equilibria.

Displays results dynamically.



2. Interactive Visualizations:

Visualizes payoff matrices using a grid or table.

Highlights equilibria within the matrix.

Draws game trees for extensive games (future enhancement).



3. Real-Time Feedback:

Error handling for invalid inputs.

Real-time updates to results and visuals when users modify inputs.



4. Scalable for Advanced Concepts:

Modules for extensive games, coalition games, and evolutionary stability can be added later.



5. Mobile-Friendly Design:

Optimized for both desktop and mobile users.

Modules and Functionalities:

1. Strategic Games Solver:

Handles zero-sum games with predefined or user-input payoff matrices.

Implements a basic algorithm to find equilibria.



2. Matrix Visualization:

Uses HTML5 Canvas to display payoff values in a grid.

Adds interactivity by coloring cells based on equilibrium.



3. Modular Design:

Separates logic for matrix operations, visualization, and user interface.

Allows future extensions like evolutionary game simulations.



4. User Interface:

Clean and minimalistic design with responsive styling.

Includes input fields, buttons, and a results display area.
